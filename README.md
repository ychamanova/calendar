## Reservation Calendar Micro Service for Free Table website

[Full Project Video](https://youtu.be/ZzSdCK_pkHU)

* Full-stack restaurant reservation application, where I focused on
reservations micro-service.
To run a server:
```javascript
npm start
```
To build files with webpack:
```javascript
npm build
```
* Built with React, the reservation component lets users send a reservation time and date to the server and get response back from the database.

* Leverages Mongoose Object Data Modeling library with
MongoDB to simplify query processing to serve Restful APIs on
the frontend.
