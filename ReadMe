Full-stack restaurant reservation application, where I focused on
reservations micro-service
Used React.js and CSS to build a responsive reservation
component
Integrated third-party components into micro-service
architecture
Leveraged Mongoose Object Data Modeling library with
MongoDB to simplify query processing to serve Restful APIs on
the frontend
Deployed micro-service on AWS EC2 for easy reproduction
and scaling
Used Trello and followed agile methodologies to streamline
development over a 3-week sprint
